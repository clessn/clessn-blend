## Purpose
This refiner is used to retrieve data from agora+, radar+ and twitter from **hub 2.0**

It is the last step of a pipeline that was created in order to produce a prototype of a shiny dashboard that will give us an idea of what the Vitrine Democratique artefacts will look like.  The resulkting Shiny dashboard will also be used in order to promote the idea of having a solid organization around the management of data and data infrastructure at the CLESSN ans more widely at uLaval.

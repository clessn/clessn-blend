# r_vd_shiny_medias_prototype


## Purpose
This refiner is used to retrieve data from Agora+, Radar+ and Twitter from **hub 2.0**

It is the last step of a pipeline that was created in order to produce a prototype of a shiny dashboard that will give us an idea of what the Vitrine DÃ©mocratique artefacts will look like.  The resulting Shiny dashboard will also be used in order to promote the idea of having a solid organization around the management of data and data infrastructure at the CLESSN and more widely at uLaval.
